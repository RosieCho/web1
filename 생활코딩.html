    <P><a href="https://ko.reactjs.org/" target="blank">React</a> is easy to learn and that is one of the most important reasons to choose this library.<BR> As it doesn’t take much time to learn this technology, you can quickly begin to build things with it.</P>
    <P>>If a technology is hard to learn, you will probably find it difficult to start.<BR> That, as it happens, it’s human nature.<BR> We avoid things that are hard to learn.</P>
    <P style="margin-top:40px">React is easy to learn not just because there are a great number of easy-to-understand tutorials available on the internet<BR> but mainly because it’s a very simple library. Unlike Angular, it’s not a complex tool.<BR> The learning process becomes easier when you have great JavaScript skills.</P>
